# VOTECHAIN

A decentralized voting system built upon a local Ethereum blockchain made available by Ganache.

### Technologies

- Truffle - framework for building Dapps (Decentralized applications) by using the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It provides the Truffle Box, which is a ready-made UI connected to the Ganache local, in-memory blockchain.
- Ganache - provides a local in-memory Ethereum-based blockchain that works on port 7545. It is created by Truffle.
- Metamask - user wallet that will be connected to the system/blockchain in order to vote. In order to cast a vote, a small sum of ETH will be taken from the user's wallet for gas fees.
- Solidity - an object-oriented language for writing and deploying smart contracts that represents the business logic of the voting system.
- web3.js - a JavaScript library with many sublibraries that enables our UI to interact with our local, in-memory Ganache Ethereum blockchain.
- HTML, CSS & JS - HTML and CSS are used for the UI of the system, while JS (along with web3.js) is used to connect our UI to the local blockchain.
